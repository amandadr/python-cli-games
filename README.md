# Python CLI Games

**TBC**

## Description

A fun and interactive way for me to brush up on Python!

Enjoy toying with an arcade of command interface line games built using Python3

### Remember to run `generate_word_list.py` to create a words.txt file for the games to utilize.

#### To do so you'll have to utilize nltk, as per requirements.txt

## Arcade Contents

- Guess the Number
- Hangman
- Word Scramble

### If you'd like to edit game parameters...

Take a peek inside!

For now, parameters need to be changed from inside the game files, but this will be updated with a more user-friendly design soon!
